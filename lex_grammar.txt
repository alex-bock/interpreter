The lexical classes are given below (in regex notation):

VAR     := letter (letter | digit)*
NUM     := "0"
         | nonzero_digit digit*
BOOLEAN := "True" | "False"
SYM     := "(" | ")"
OP      := "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
COMMENT := "#" (non_newline + E)*

where:

- "letter" is the set of all lowercase or uppercase Roman-alphabet letters,
- "digit" is the set of all digits from 0 to 9 ("nonzero_digit", intuitively, is a subset excluding 0),
- "non_newline" is the set of all ASCII characters excluding the newline character '\n', and
- "E" is the null character, i.e. nothing at all.
